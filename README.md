Food reservation application

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This application uses Serverless and AWS DynamoDB for api calls, so we need to install Serverless and configure AWS credentials.

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/souphan/noms.git
```

Change directory into `noms`:
```
cd noms
```

Now install NPM dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the application:

```
ng serve
```
